# Hacktoberfest-2021
Participate in Hacktoberfest by contributing to FORCE-IIITU in this repository. 

## Help Contributing Guides :crown:

We love to have `articles` and `codes` in different languages and `betterment` of existing ones.

### Read on to find out how to make a contribution:

**Note**: Before you start working on an issue, kindly state what you are doing specifically in the concerned issue or create a new issue. 

**You can create your own issue to add a content which you do not see in the current code base** üéâ 
Kindly browse through the code base to ensure that what you intend to implement does not exist already. 

**Naming convention**: folders and filenames should be in _lowercase_ and each word separated by `_`. Names should be descriptive to certain extend. üëç 

There are 2 basic types of contribution:

* ### Add code for a particular category

In this contribution type, one submits a pull request consisting of a code in a particular language. We accept every language as in our community, we will always find someone who used even the most esoteric or unknown language. To name a few language, you must try to add a contribution in `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `Python`, `Go`, `JavaScript`, `C#`, `Swift`, `F#` and many others.

* ### Add an explanation for code category

In this contribution, one must provide an explanation to a code category in markdown format under the code category folder. This is very important contribution in making the learning experience better.
